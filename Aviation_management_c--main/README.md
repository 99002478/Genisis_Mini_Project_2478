<h2>Module/s</h2> 
Modules linked to the miniproject - C++ 

<h2>Topic and Subtopics</h2>

Virtual Functions- A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class.

Dynamic Binding- C++ provides facility to specify that the compiler should match function calls with the correct definition at the run time; this is called dynamic binding or late binding or run-time binding. Dynamic binding is achieved using virtual functions. Base class pointer points to derived class object.

Templates- A template is a simple and yet very powerful tool in C++. The simple idea is to pass data type as a parameter so that we donâ€™t need to write the same code for different data types.

File Handling- Files are used to store data in a storage device permanently. File handling provides a mechanism to store the output of a program in a file and to perform various operations on it.

STL Containers- The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as vector, lists, stacks, etc.

Iterators- Iterators are used to point at the memory addresses of STL containers. They are primarily used in sequence of numbers, characters etc. They reduce the complexity and execution time of program.

<h2>Implementation Summary</h2> 
The project Aviation Management was implemented using C++ concepts like Virtual functions, Dynamic Binding, Templates, File Handling, STL concepts, Iterators.
By using the virtual functions the Inheritance concepts are used like the Flight class is inherited by the Passenger class. The File Handling concepts helped in taking the values from the file which was in the csv format.
